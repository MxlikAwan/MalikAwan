      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>The Ford Mustang was introduced in April 1964, creating a new class of automobiles known as the "pony car." Its sleek design, affordable price, and powerful performance made it an instant hit, with over a million units sold within the first two years. Since then, the Mustang has evolved through multiple generations, becoming an iconic symbol of American muscle cars and maintaining its legacy as a blend of style, power, and innovation.</p>
